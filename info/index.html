          <p>We want your child to feel happy and safe with us. During the settling-in period you will meet your childâ€™s
            key worker and they will be able to support you if you are feeling anxious and answer any questions you may
            have.</p>

          <p>Our setting believes that care and education are equally important in the experience which we offer
            children. The routines and activities that make up the session/day in the setting are provided in ways that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Help each child to feel that she/he is a valued member of the setting</li>
            <li>Ensure the safety of each child</li>
            <li>Help children to gain from the social experience of being part of a group</li>
            <li>Provide children with opportunities to learn and help them to value learning.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The setting organises the day so that children can take part in a variety of child-chosen and adult-led
            activities. These take account of children&rsquo;s changing energy levels throughout the day.</p>
          <p>The setting caters for children&rsquo;s individual needs for rest and quiet activities during the day.</p>
          <p>Outdoor activities contribute to children&rsquo;s health, their physical development and their knowledge of
            the world around them.</p>
          <p>Babies are fed and changed according to their routine and needs and can sleep according to their own
            routine.</p>
